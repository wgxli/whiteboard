# Simple Whiteboard

A simple whiteboard for scratchwork. Best used with a drawing tablet that has remappable buttons.

## Keyborad Shortcuts
- -: Decrease pen size
- +: Increase pen size
- C: Cycle between paper types
- E: Clear whiteboard
- G: Black pen
- H: Red pen
- I: Blue pen
- J: Green pen
- K: Cycle between dash styles
- L: Reset pen to defaults

To save the whiteboard, I open the page in fullscreen and have one of the drawing tablet's keys mapped to the Print Screen button.

Note that the whiteboard will only resize when it is cleared.
