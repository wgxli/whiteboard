# Simple Whiteboard

A simple whiteboard for scratchwork. Best used with a drawing tablet that has remappable buttons.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- -: Decrease pen size
- +: Increase pen size
- C: Cycle between paper types (will clear the page)
- E: Previous page
- F: Next/new page
- G: Black pen
- H: Red pen
- I: Blue pen
- J: Green pen
- K: Cycle between dash styles
- L: Reset pen to defaults

To save the whiteboard, I open the page in fullscreen and have one of the drawing tablet's keys mapped to the Print Screen button.

Note that the whiteboard will only resize when new pages are added or the paper type is changed.
